#Day 13: Roots of polynomial

While thereâ€™s no analytical solution for higher order polynomials, numerical solution is just an application of linear algebra.
<br/>
All we need is to construct a matrix whose characteristic polynomial is the one we are solving.
<br/>
To get the roots we then find eigenvalues of the matrix.
